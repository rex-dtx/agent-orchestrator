# Claude Code Multi-Account Management Design

## Status

Design for follow-on implementation on `codex/codex-account-management`. The
Codex implementation remains provider-specific; Claude Code receives a sibling
subsystem that follows the same daemon/API boundaries without copying Codex's
session restart policy.

## Goal

Let a macOS user add, reauthenticate, locally sign out, delete, and switch
Claude Code subscription accounts. Adding an account must leave the current
device account active. Switching is device-global and hot: AO does not fork,
stop, or resume Claude conversations and does not impose an artificial wait.

## State and secret ownership

```text
~/.ao/harnesses/claude-code/
|-- accounts/<account-uuid>/account.json
|-- pending-accounts/<operation-id>/
|   |-- config/
|   `-- auth/
`-- switch-staging/<switch-id>/
```

Descriptors contain only an allowlisted account identity and timestamps.
OAuth material remains in macOS Keychain:

- Claude's canonical item uses service `Claude Code-credentials` and Claude's
  normal username-derived account key.
- AO's account vault uses service `Agent Orchestrator Claude Accounts` and the
  Claude account UUID as the Keychain account.
- Temporary rollback data uses service
  `Agent Orchestrator Claude Switch Rollbacks` and the switch UUID.

No secret bytes or Keychain identities cross the domain, SQLite, API, logging,
telemetry, or renderer boundaries.

## Adding and reauthenticating accounts

AO opens a trusted shell terminal running `claude auth login` with an isolated
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR`. Claude derives the
isolated Keychain service by NFC-normalizing the raw secure-storage path,
SHA-256 hashing it, and appending the first eight hex characters to
`Claude Code-credentials-`.

After login, AO runs `claude auth status --json` in the same environment,
requires `loggedIn: true`, matches `oauthAccount.accountUuid`, and transfers
account-owned fields into AO's Keychain vault. The canonical credential and
`~/.claude.json` are not changed by Add. Reauthentication requires the selected
UUID; active-account reauthentication updates the canonical credential under
the same switch locks.

## Credential ownership and activation

The account vault owns `claudeAiOauth`, `trustedDeviceToken`, and unknown
non-shared siblings. Activation preserves only the live machine-shared
allowlist: `mcpOAuth`, `mcpOAuthClientConfig`, `mcpXaaIdp`,
`mcpXaaIdpConfig`, and `pluginSecrets`. This prevents account-bound device or
future fields from leaking across accounts while keeping shared integrations
current.

AO cooperates with Claude's proper-lockfile protocol. It acquires
`~/.claude/.oauth_refresh.lock`, then `~/.claude.lock`, both with a 60-second
stale threshold, and uses `~/.claude.json.lock` with a 10-second threshold for
identity writes. Locks are touched every three seconds and have a bounded
nine-second acquisition budget.

## Durable hot switch

```text
verify target in isolated staging
    -> acquire AO exclusive admission
    -> acquire Claude credential locks
    -> snapshot canonical credential and identity in rollback Keychain item
    -> checkpoint the latest source credential
    -> merge target account fields with live shared fields
    -> replace canonical Keychain item
    -> patch only oauthAccount in ~/.claude.json
    -> verify normal Claude auth and target identity
    -> CAS the active account pointer
    -> return immediately
```

Switch phases are `requested`, `verifying_target`, `checkpointing_source`,
`activating_target`, `updating_identity`, `verifying_global`,
`rollback_required`, `recovery_required`, `completed`, and `failed`.
Completed switches expose `propagationUncertainUntil`, 30 seconds after commit.
This is a local credential-cache uncertainty window, not a forced delay or
server-side refresh schedule.

On restart, a nonterminal switch reacquires exclusive admission. A canonical
target identity completes the active-pointer CAS; a source identity fails
safely; an unknown identity restores the rollback snapshot. Unverifiable
rollback enters `recovery_required` and continues blocking new AO-owned Claude
controller admission.

## Session and usage semantics

Running Claude TUI, Chat, and reviewer controllers are not restarted. Their
native UUIDs, ACP conversation IDs, worktrees, and transcript roots remain
unchanged. Default-store standalone Claude processes and integrations observe
the new credential after their local cache refreshes; isolated profiles and
environment-authenticated processes are unaffected.

Because the AO session and native usage binding do not change, historical
usage is not re-counted. Existing source cursors and event keys continue to
deduplicate prior records. Total cost remains exact; account-specific
attribution is explicitly uncertain until propagation completes.

## Scope

Version one supports macOS OAuth subscriptions with Claude Code 2.1.220 or
newer. It excludes API-key accounts, remote OAuth revocation, capacity/reset
data, CLI commands, Linux/Windows account management, account epochs, session
forking, and automatic exit/resume. If live validation proves hot propagation
unreliable, exit/resume is a separate follow-up using the existing Claude TUI
`--resume` UUID and ACP `session/load` contracts.
